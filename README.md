<h1>Overview</h1>

RasPyCam is a python-based multi-stream camera system for the Raspberry Pi. This application has been designed as a replacement for the [RasPiCam](https://github.com/silvanmelchior/userland/tree/master/host_applications/linux/apps/raspicam) application developed by [Silvan Melchior](https://github.com/silvanmelchior), [Robert Tidey](https://github.com/roberttidey) and [others](https://github.com/silvanmelchior/RPi_Cam_Web_Interface/graphs/contributors) which is no longer maintained and has compatibility issues with the latest versions of the Raspberry Pi.

There are two ways of using RasPyCam:

1. **As a standalone program**: The program can be run on a Raspberry Pi with a camera module connected to it. The program will respond to manual command calls and perform the necessary actions. This method will use the source code provided in this repository.
2. **As a backend service**: The program can be run on a Raspberry Pi with a camera module connected to it alongside the [RPi Cam Web Interface](https://github.com/silvanmelchior/RPi_Cam_Web_Interface) system. The program will respond to the commands sent by the frontend and perform the necessary actions. This method will use the executable file created from the source code provided in this repository. As of version 1, the executable file is shipped with the [RPi Cam Web Interface](https://github.com/silvanmelchior/RPi_Cam_Web_Interface) system. Future updates to this repository will update the executable file in the frontend system.

<h1>Main Features</h1>

- **Preview**: Retrieve the camera feed in real time.
- **Image Capture**: Capture images from the connected camera.
- **Video Recording**: Record videos from the connected camera.
- **Motion Detection**: Detect motion in the camera feed.
- **Timelapse Image Capture**: Capture periodic images from the connected camera.
- **Multi-Stream Support**: Stream multiple camera feeds simultaneously from the connected camera.
- **Web Interface Support**: Interact with the program using the [RPi Cam Web Interface](https://github.com/silvanmelchior/RPi_Cam_Web_Interface) system.

<h1>Requirements</h1>

Depending on how you run the program, you may need to install some dependencies, including [PiCamera 2](https://pypi.org/project/picamera2/0.2.2/), [OpenCV](https://pypi.org/project/opencv-python/), and [Pillow](https://pypi.org/project/pillow/).

If you would like to run the source code, you can install these libraries using the following commands:

```bash
pip install picamera2 opencv-python Pillow
```

<h1>Installation</h1>

1. Clone the repository to your Raspberry Pi:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/windermere-technology/raspycam.git
```

2. Run the installation script to install the program and its dependencies:

> [!NOTE]
> Depending on your Pi's configuration, you may need to run the program with `sudo` privileges. This is because the program requires read/write access to the tmp and var directories which are restricted to root access.

```bash
sudo ./install.sh
```

You will be prompted if you want the frontend ([RPi Cam Web Interface](https://github.com/silvanmelchior/RPi_Cam_Web_Interface)) to be install alongside the program. Select `y` if you want to install the frontend, otherwise select `n`.

After the install script finished, you can run the program standalone by running the following command, or it will run automatically with the frontend:

```bash
raspimjpeg [--config /path/to/config1 /path/to/config2 ...]
```

`path/to/config` is the path to the configuration file you want to use. If you don't specify a configuration file, the program will use the default configuration file provided in the repository. Provide 2 config will apply the settings to 2 cameras.

<h1>Usage</h1>

RasPyCam is a continuously running program that observes the commands sent to the named pipe (by default this is `/var/FIFO`).

To send commands to the program, you can use the following commands:

```bash
echo '{command} {parameter}' > /var/FIFO
```

> [!NOTE]
> While the front end is running, the RasPyCam program will be running under www-data user. This means that the FIFO file will be located in `/var/www/html/FIFO` instead of `/var/FIFO`. And you will need to send commands as www-data user.

```bash
sudo su -c "echo '{command} {parameter}' >> /var/www/html/FIFO" www-data
```

> [!NOTE]
> Angled brackets refer to \<optional parameters\>.

> [!NOTE]
> Square brackets are used to send commands to multiple cameras. Command and sets of parameters are separated by commas. Forward slashes escape commas. Leading and trailing whitespaces are not stripped from parameters. Not enclosing parameters within brackets applies the parameters to all bracketed commands.

> Example 1: `[dp,dp] [0,1]` = Switches off preview for Camera 0, switches on preview for Camera 1.

> Example 2: `[im,an] [,Look/, an annotation!]` = Takes a still image with Camera 0, sets the annotation for Camera 1 to "Look, an annotation!".

> Example 3: `[,im] ` = Camera 0 is not sent any command. Takes an image with Camera 1.

> Example 4: `[ca,ca] 1` = Starts recording on both Camera 0 and Camera 1.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The commands `ix+ix` and `im+im` can only be used within square brackets, even if only sent to 1 camera.

Currently the program supports the following commands:

<h2>Camera Control</h2>

| Command | Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ru` | 1/0 | Starts (1) or stops (0) the camera. The program continues to run while the camera is stopped, but the only accepted command will be `ru 1` to restart. |
| `cn` | {number} | Changes the main camera to the specified number. The number corresponds to the slot index of Picam2's `all_cameras()` function. |
| `fl` | 0/1/2/3 | Sets horizontal and vertical flip. The parameters are: no flip (0), horizontal flip (1), vertical flip (2), and both horizontal and vertical flip (3). The default is 0. |
| `dp` | 1/0 | Enables (1) or disables (0) the camera preview. If multiple cameras have previews enabled and share the same image height, they will be stitched together horizontally. |

| `sy` | {script} <args> | Executes a user-defined macro script located in /var/www/html/macros/. {script} is the script file name (e.g., mktimelapse.sh). | 

If the program is initated without a specified configuration file, the program will utilise the following paths for inputs and outputs:
| Type | Path |
| --- | --- |
| Preview | /tmp/preview/cam*preview.jpg |
| Videos | /tmp/media/vi_cam%I*%v*%Y%M%D*%h%m%s.mp4 |
| Stills | /tmp/media/im*cam%I*%i*%Y%M%D*%h%m%s.jpg |
| Status File | /tmp/status_mjpeg.txt |

> Command names, parameters and paths have been sourced from the [RPi Cam Web Interface](https://github.com/silvanmelchior/RPi_Cam_Web_Interface) system to ensure compatibility. In addition to the existing naming scheme used to interpolate values into filenames, the code %I can be used to refer a camera's index number.

<h2>Filename Creation</h2>

Filenames can be created with standard text alongside the following naming scheme:

| Code | Description |
| --- | --- |
| %Y | Four-digit year (e.g., 2023) |
| %y | Two-digit year (e.g., 23) |
| %M | Month (01-12) |
| %D | Day of the month (01-31) |
| %h | Hour (00-23) |
| %m | Minute (00-59) |
| %s | Second (00-59) |
| %u | Milliseconds (000-999) |
| %i | Image index (increments with each image captured) |
| %v | Video index (increments with each video recorded) |
| %t | Timelapse fileset index (increments with each new set of timelapse images captured) |
| %I | Camera index, indicating the camera number if multiple cameras are used |
| %a | Custom annotation text, provided by the user |
| %% | Literal % symbol in the filename |

> [!NOTE]
> The `%a` code will read the text from the `/dev/shm/mjpeg/user_annotate.txt` file by default. This file must be created by the user. You may change this default path in the configuration file by adjusting the `user_annotate` parameter.

<h2>Stopping the Program</h2>

To stop the program, you can either send SIGINT or SIGTERM signals to the program. This can be done by either pressing `Ctrl+C` in the terminal running the program or by using the `kill` command.

If you've launched the program using the source code, run the following command:

```bash
sudo kill -9 $(cat /opt/vc/bin/raspycam/raspy.pid)
```

Or if you've launched the program using the front-end, navigate to the front-end directory and run the following command, or simply press the stop button in the front-end:

```bash
sudo ./stop.sh
```
